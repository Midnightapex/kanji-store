# Kanjo x Spirit — Code-Only Package (Deploy Fast)

This package excludes large images to keep file size tiny. Your Stripe Payment Links are already wired.

## Add your images
Upload the three real images into `/assets` with **exact** names:
- `hoodie.png`
- `decals.png`
- `flag.png`

(They'll replace the tiny placeholders included here.)

## Deploy to Netlify (no local tools required)
1) Create a GitHub repo (empty).  
2) Upload **all files** from this folder via GitHub's web UI, including the `/assets` images you added.  
3) In Netlify, click **Add new site → Import from Git**, choose your repo, build settings = static site (no build command).  
4) Click Deploy. You get a live URL in ~30 seconds.

## Pricing (CAD)
- Hoodie: $35
